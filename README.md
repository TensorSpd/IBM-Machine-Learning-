# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate (Coursera)

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, TensorFlow, pandas, Jupyter

This program includes six comprehensive courses designed to build proficiency in key areas of Machine Learning, covering Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, as well as specialized areas like Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning 

This project aims to analyze data related to healthy life expectancy and the number of years lived with disability across various countries and years.

## Supervised Learning: Regression 

Utilized linear regression algorithms to develop a model that predicts the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, exploring the relationship between GDP, Human Development Index, and total number of deaths.

## Supervised Learning: Classification 

Leveraged classifier models to predict conflicting classifications of human genetic variants in the ClinVar database, a public resource for annotations of human genetic variants.

## Unsupervised Learning 

Applied clustering techniques to New York Stock Exchange historical metrics data to identify the optimal algorithm for predicting whether a company will report a net profit or net loss.

## Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning 

Employed images of Egyptian hieroglyphs from the Pyramid of Unas to train an image classifier from scratch and utilized transfer learning to build a model that recognizes different hieroglyphs and predicts their Gardiner labels.

## Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis 

Used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast Google daily stock market prices, focusing on predicting the 'Close' series.
